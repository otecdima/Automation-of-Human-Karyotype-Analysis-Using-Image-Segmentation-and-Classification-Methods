Human karyotype analysis or karyotype test is the technique used in the field of genetics for conducting a diagnosis, which may help to check oneâ€™s chromosomes and identify if there are any genetic problems that cause disorders or diseases. The methods currently used in labs to create karyograms by classification and arrangement are manual, but with the development of machine learning methods, the human karyotype analysis can be automated, which will be more efficient as will take much less time and will be more accurate. Although there are several studies that describe the approaches of the machine learning algorithms with image processing of human karyotype, they suffer from issues such as the lack of data or the limited number of methods used. That only emphasises the need to develop new approaches for the task of karyotype image analysis.
